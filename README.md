It features a radial playing field and a call-and-response mode. Play as Aria, a compassionate young woman who always helps others, as she learns to ask for help herself too. 

The game is built on the Unity engine, using C# scripting. A working demo with a tutorial level, as well as two full levels, are planned for completion by the end of the Spring Semester 2023.
